# Password-generator

## Description ##

This web page is a Password Generator. It functions as a randomizer of all types of characters needed for a password to use, whether it be lowercase, uppercase, numeric values, or special characters. Since the application was fairly straight forward to build, most of the source materials I used were straight from the class content that we worked on as well as the mini project. I was struggling to get started, so I had help from a tutor during the beginning, and I also struggled at the end to get the final code to work properly so I had a session with a tutor then as well.
The code that can be seen from the help I received from Sam Cordova is on lines 109-118 of the script.js file.

Class material, and Sam Cordova as the tutor who provided me assistance.
